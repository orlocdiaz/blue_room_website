            Chris Lord-Alge’s talent is exemplified by his AllMusic credit list containing an astonishing
            1100 entries, with huge names such as Bruce Springsteen, Tina Turner, Avril Lavigne, Cher, Muse,
            Celine Dion, Michael Bublé, Aerosmith, Madonna, Green Day, Meat Loaf, U2, Snow Patrol, Sheryl
            Crow, Savage Garden, Bon Jovi, Fleetwood Mac, Black Eyed Peas, The Rolling Stones, Smashing
            Pumpkins, James Brown, Eric Clapton, Nine Inch Nails, Foo Fighters, My Chemical Romance and many
            more.
            <br>
            He has won six Grammy Awards, and with his position as one of the world’s leading mixers, has
            been nicknamed ‘Lord of the Mix’. His dominance is illustrated perfectly by Lord-Alge’s
            initials, CLA, being an instantly recognizable brand name within the music industry. For
            example, the creation of the Waves ‘Chris Lord-Alge Signature series’, features plugins aptly
            titled, CLA Drums, CLA Bass, and CLA Guitars, and so on, that represent his work and style.
            <br>
            Chris Lord-Alge achieves his unique sound through an equally unique approach, which has remained
            largely unchanged since the late 1990s. His two main tools of the trade are a 60-input 4056
            E-series SSL desk and his beloved Sony 3348 48-track digital tape recorder. The only major
            change in his approach has come from the omnipresence of the DAW, with Lord-Alge now using
            plugins in Pro Tools to complement the outboard in his studio, Mix LA.

            Sylvia Massy is an American entrepreneur, music producer, mixer and engineer, writer and artist
            based in the United States. Massy is perhaps best recognized for her work on 1993’s Undertow,
            the full-length double platinum-selling debut for Los Angeles rock band Tool and her works with
            System of a Down, Johnny Cash and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
            <br>
            While working at Larrabee Sound in West Hollywood, Sylvia connected with producer Rick Rubin and
            would work with him on several projects including Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Slayer,
            Donovan, Geto Boys, The Black Crowes, Danzig, and System of a Down’s debut album, as well as
            Johnny Cash’s album Unchained, which won a Grammy award for Best Country Album in 1997. Further
            into the ’90s, Massy continued to produce many popular artists, aforementioned Red Hot Chili
            Peppers, Sevendust, and Powerman 5000, which featured guest appearances from Rob Zombie and
            actor Malachi Throne from Star Trek fame. In 1997 alone, Massy co-produced, engineered and mixed
            Foo Fighters, Björk, Patti Smith, Sonic Youth and for the Beastie Boys’ « Tibetan Freedom
            Concert » in New York with Adam Yauch and producer Pat McCarthy.
            <br>
            Also during her time in Los Angeles, Massy engineered, produced or mixed on recordings from a
            diverse group of internationally-known artists, including Aerosmith, Babyface, Big Daddy Kane,
            Bobby Brown, Prince, Julio Iglesias, Seal, Skunk Anansie, Paula Abdul, Ryuichi Sakamoto and many
            more. Not to mention her work with manager Gary Kurfirst on Irish rock band Cyclefly for
            Kurfirst’s Radioactive Records. Massy’s repertoire is far and wide, giving her a continuously
            competitive edge and ability to create with artists across genres and decades.

            Michael Brauer is one of the founding members of the seminar program. Brauer has an impressive
            back catalogue, having worked with Luther Vandross, Aretha Franklin, The Rolling Stones, Bob
            Dylan, Paul McCartney, Coldplay, John Mayer, Ash, My Morning Jacket, Ben Folds, Eric Clapton,
            Prefab Sprout, Leonard Cohen, Pet Shop Boys, Dream Theater, Elle King, James Bay and Calle 13 to
            name but a few. He has won seven Grammy Awards, including best engineered album for John Mayer's
            "Battle Studies".
            <br>
            He currently works in Electric Lady Studio B in New York, where he works with an SSL 9080
            J-series desk, as well as an vast collection of outboard. The outboard is at the heart of
            Brauer’s approach to using compression and EQ, that is so elaborate that Brauer has given it a
            trademarked name: “Brauerize”. The mixer explains that it, “is the combination of a few
            different compression techniques, including multi-bus, parallel and post-fader send/return
            compression, which focus on mixing into compression, allowing me to ride instruments, vocals,
            and my entire mix, into the sweet spot.”
            <br>
            Brauer’s ‘Brauerizing’ technique, of parallel compression of vocals and/or instruments is
            complimented with his heavy use of software, which as he describes, allows things that one
            cannot get from the hardware, such as “great de-essers and fixing tools”.

            Andrew Scheps has an incredible career of achievements, which incorporates a credit list featuring Red Hot
            Chili Peppers, Adele, Metallica, Black Sabbath, Michael Jackson, Robbie Robertson, Justin Timberlake, Iggy
            Pop, U2, Jay-Z, and many more, as well as several Grammy Awards.
            <br>
            Scheps’ work on the Red Hot Chili Pepper’s album Stadium Arcadium in 2005 was a turning point for his
            approach to engineering. He found the band’s decision to record and mix entirely in analogue so refreshing
            that he fitted his Punkerpad West studio with two Neve 8068 desks to go with his wall of analogue outboard.
            Scheps continued to work like this until the fall of 2013, when he was offered a different kind of project
            to mix. A choice faced him: either pass on the work and continue with his methods where he was in France at
            the time, or accept the mission and take a more in the box approach to his work.
            <br>
            He opted for the latter, and found what he initially regarded as a one-off was much more attractive than
            anticipated. “Going back into the box wasn’t a sonic decision, but I actually re-discovered that I really
            like it. It’s great to be able to work on three or four songs at the same time. I have not gone back to
            working on the desk since then. While I miss some of the visceral hands-on aspects of the console, there is
            a lot of creative freedom working this way. It might seem like a drastic change, but it is only the tools
            that have changed: remarkably my philosophy and sound have stayed the same.”

            Tony Maserati is one of the world’s leading mix engineers. Over the course of his working career
            he has amassed a list of credits that runs into the hundreds, with worldwide sales of over 100
            million units including names such as Beyoncé, Robin Thicke, Jason Mraz, k.d. Lang, Mary J
            Blige, David Bowie, Usher, Puff Daddy, Notorious BIG, Jay-Z, Lady Gaga, Avril Lavigne, Cher,
            Keith Urban, R Kelly, Destiny’s Child, Jennifer Lopez, Alicia Keys, Lil’ Kim, and the Black Eyed
            Peas. Maserati is a Grammy Awards winning engineer, he's one of the few mixers with a Waves
            Signature Plugin Series — The Tony Maserati Collection — turning his name into a global brand.
            <br>
            Maserati is known for his hybrid analog/digital setup approach that he has favoured for many
            years, as well as his effects comprising a combination of the best of digital, (using plugins by
            Waves, UAD, Soundtoys, Softube and many others), and the best of analog by way of Alan Smart,
            Telefunken, Shadow Hills, Pendulum, Universal Audio, Chandler, Neve and Urei. Analog gear
            continues to prove invaluable to Maserati because of, he says, “the headroom”. However, Maserati
            also advocates the portability of 21C digital equipment, and regularly mixes while travelling
            using a laptop with Sennheiser HD600 headphones, Pelonis Model 42s speakers, and a Black Lion
            DAC.
